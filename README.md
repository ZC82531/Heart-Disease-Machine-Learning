# Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease using a dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Structure

- **heart.csv**  
  The Kaggle dataset containing patient information and medical attributes relevant to heart disease prediction.

- **Heart Disease Machine Learning Models.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter Notebook with data exploration, preprocessing, and machine learning model training.

- **kaggle_documentation.pdf**  
  Documentation describing the dataset, including data types and attribute details.

- **Heart Disease Machine Learning Presentation.pptx**  
  A presentation providing a high-level overview of the project, results, and key insights.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and ensure all files are in the same directory.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Heart Disease Machine Learning Models.ipynb`.
